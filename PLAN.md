# Right now (2018-01-09)

After looking over https://github.com/stuartpb/how-i-roll/blob/master/starting/apps.md and https://github.com/stuartpb/help-wanted, I'm working right now on putting together a greater index of my projects as I want to pursue them as [unusualstudio-projects](https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects).

I'm thinking I'll do it as a directory full of YAML files describing each project by UUID, which will be processed in CI into a commit that regenerates the project page for unusual.studio.

## Email transition

I'm currently transitioning my email address from stuart@testtrack4.com (DreamHost) to s@stuartpb.com (FastMail).

It's currently held up on my registrar (Porkbun) locking me out, so I can't point the DNS servers for the old domain to FastMail. I'm currently waiting on Porkbun Support to resolve this.

# Schedule

I'm generally available at any time Monday through Friday from noon to 6:00 Pacific time, with the exception of one fixed appointment on Wednesdays from 2:30-3:30 Pacific time. (This week, I've moved this appointment to Friday 2018-01-12.)
