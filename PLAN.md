After bashing my head against [adding a generalized path extrusion to OpenJSCAD with rounded corners](https://github.com/jscad/csg.js/issues/68), I've decided to just let whoever ultimately tackles path extrusion handle it, and stick to my original plan of using a combination of `linearExtrude` and `rotateExtrude` with translation in [millwork.jscad][].
