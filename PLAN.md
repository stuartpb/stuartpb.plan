# Right now (2018-01-08)

I'm currently transitioning my email address from stuart@testtrack4.com (DreamHost) to s@stuartpb.com (FastMail).

After bashing my head against [adding a generalized path extrusion to OpenJSCAD with rounded corners](https://github.com/jscad/csg.js/issues/68), I've decided to just let whoever ultimately tackles path extrusion handle it, and stick to my original plan of using a combination of `linearExtrude` and `rotateExtrude` with translation in [millwork.jscad][].

## Schedule

I'm generally available at any time Monday through Friday from noon to 6:00 Pacific time, with the exception of one fixed appointment on Wednesdays from 2:30-3:30 Pacific time.
