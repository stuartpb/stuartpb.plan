# Right now (2018-01-09)

I'm currently transitioning my email address from stuart@testtrack4.com (DreamHost) to s@stuartpb.com (FastMail). It's currently held up on my registrar (Porkbun) locking me out, so I can't point the DNS servers for the old domain to FastMail. I'm currently waiting on Porkbun Support to resolve this.

I think I just hit on a breakthrough for my [collected writings][] in that, when I was thinking about the stuff I'd want to add to [github-best-practices][], I remembered that [one of the most useful practices is kicking off issues to informally record ideas you'd like to develop later](https://github.com/stuartpb/collected-writings/commit/14ac32b400dbe1d7a95f507638e26eb13160b9c0), which led me to realize I ought to be doing this with daunting *writing* projects as well. Now, I've got something to show and work off of in *that* repo, and I'm gearing up to go back and add some stuff to "[At Least Three Ways to Do Anything in Three.js](https://github.com/stuartpb/threejs-ways-to-do-it)" as well.
