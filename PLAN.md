# Right now (2018-01-13)

I'm working right now on putting together a greater index of projects / ideas I'm working on / interested in as I want to pursue them in [unusualstudio-projects](https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects) (sort of a lighter-weight successor to https://github.com/stuartpb/help-wanted). I'm structuring it as a directory full of YAML files describing each project, named by UUID.

I started by putting together [a few initial description files][ff2ec85] by hand, but it felt like a *major* slog, so I went ahead and wrote [a couple scripts][83e0c53] that should make transcribing these much easier.

[ff2ec85]: https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects/commit/ff2ec8501e1de6c1aea396a78e443f7511051275
[83e0c53]: https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects/commit/83e0c53d965938c7b17b69c3ce0dcf514e0574ae

## Email transition

I'm currently transitioning my email address from stuart@testtrack4.com (DreamHost) to s@stuartpb.com (FastMail).

It's currently held up on my registrar (Porkbun) locking me out, so I can't point the DNS servers for the old domain to FastMail. I'm currently waiting on Porkbun Support to resolve this.

# Schedule

I'm generally available at any time Monday through Friday from noon to 6:00 Pacific time, with the exception of one fixed appointment on Wednesdays from 2:30-3:30 Pacific time. (This week, I've moved this appointment to Friday 2018-01-12.)
